"""JSONL event log subscriber for structured workflow diagnostics.

Subscribes to the ``WorkflowEventEmitter`` and writes every event as a JSON
line. A newly created log is placed in ``$TMPDIR/conductor/`` (or a directory
specified by ``runtime.event_log_dir``). The log file is always created — no
CLI flag required — so diagnostic data is available for every run.

Example::

    from conductor.engine.event_log import EventLogSubscriber

    subscriber = EventLogSubscriber(workflow_name="my-workflow")
    emitter.subscribe(subscriber.on_event)
    # ... run workflow ...
    subscriber.close()
    print(f"Logs at: {subscriber.path}")

The ``run_id`` format this subscriber accepts/mints is not defined here --
it defers entirely to :mod:`conductor.run_id`, the single shared contract
also used by the fleet run-record store and its filename parsers. See
that module's docstring for why the contract lives there rather than
here.

            existing_path: When provided alongside ``existing_run_id``
                and the file is writable, open it in append mode and
                continue writing to the original log instead of creating
                a new one. Used by ``resume_workflow_async`` so a
                resumed run produces one continuous JSONL log across
                resume generations.
            existing_run_id: The run identifier associated with
                ``existing_path``. Reused (not regenerated) so log /
                timeline correlation tools see one continuous run.
            event_log_dir: Preferred base directory for a freshly created
                log, replacing the default ``$TMPDIR/conductor/`` when it is
                usable. An OS error while creating or opening the log falls
                back to the default. This value is ignored when the
                ``existing_path`` append branch is taken, so a resumed run
                keeps writing to the log its checkpoint points at. Callers

        provided, the run id is taken from the ``CONDUCTOR_RUN_ID``

        shared fleet run-id contract (:mod:`conductor.run_id`) — used
        by :mod:`conductor.cli.bg_runner` to propagate the
        parent-chosen run id to the detached child so all artefacts
        of a single bg run share the same id in their filenames (see
        issue #116). Otherwise a fresh random id is generated.
